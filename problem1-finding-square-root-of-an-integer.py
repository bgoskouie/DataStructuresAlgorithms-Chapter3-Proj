# Finding the Square Root of an Integer
# Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library. You have to find the floor value of the square root.

# For example if the given number is 16, then the answer would be 4.

# If the given number is 27, the answer would be 5 because sqrt(5) = 5.196 whose floor value is 5.

# The expected time complexity is O(log(n))

# Here is some boilerplate code and test cases to start with:
