Time Complexity:   O(n)
Space Complexity:   O(n)


The algorithm uses a trie data structure and thus space and time are of Big O of (n).
It implements a RouteTrieNode object that holds every instance of an object held within a trie.
It also implements a RouteTie object that holds the whole trie. The whole trie includes RouteTrieNode objects.
It also implements a Router object that holds the trie and implements the wrapping functinons, creating the trie, inserting, adding handler,...
